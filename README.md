# 🌿 Plant Disease Recommendation System 🌱

## 🌟 Overview
The **Plant Disease Recommendation System** is a machine learning-based project designed to identify plant diseases using images and recommend suitable treatments. It leverages a dataset from Kaggle and employs deep learning techniques for classification and analysis.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). It contains labeled images of various plant diseases, categorized by plant type and disease condition.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- 🐍 **Python**: Core programming language
- 🔬 **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning framework for model training
- 📷 **OpenCV**: Image processing library
- 🌐 **Flask/FastAPI**: Backend framework for serving the model
- 🎨 **Streamlit/React**: Frontend for user interaction
- 📊 **NumPy & Pandas**: Data manipulation libraries
